This is place to keep my projects from the [ed2go](https://www.ed2go.com/) classes I have taken as part of my [local library membership](https://calgarylibrary.ca/).

## Classes

#### [Introduction to CSS3 and HTML5](https://www.ed2go.com/courses/computer-science/programming/ilc/css-and-xhtml-introduction)
Create state-of-the-art, modern websites like the pros using CSS3 and HTML5. This course will provide you with the foundation you need to master these two critical and fast-growing new web languages through hands-on training and expert instruction. 

The class was taught by **Alan Simpson**, and he did a great job. I highly recoment taking a class taugh by Alan if you have the chance and are new to coding, or just new to the topic he is covering. Check out his website [HERE](https://alansimpson.me/) where he has lots of great tips and freebies.
